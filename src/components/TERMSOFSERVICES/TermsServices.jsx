                            <li>Crypto Car Club facilitates trade among a diverse community of buyers and sellers. Openness is one of our most prized values, and we are committed to providing a Platform for the exchange of Crypto Assets linked to controversial content. These policies ensure that the Platform offers the widest selection of assets possible while promoting trust and respect, as well as adherence to the law. Crypto Car Club has always exercised judgment in allowing or disallowing certain assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections consistent with the spirit of openness in a worldwide community of users of a radical new technology. We carefully consider the complete situation and all its details in light of our policies before deciding whether to remove inappropriate assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections when
                                we discover them or they are brought to our attention.</li>
                            <li>Crypto Assets linked to assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that Crypto Car Club deems inappropriate, disruptive, or illegal are prohibited on Crypto Car Club. Crypto Car Club reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of listings on its site and remove any listing at any time.

Crypto Car Club cannot destroy or impound your assets or smart contracts, but we reserve the right to destroy inappropriate
                                metadata stored on our servers (as applicable).</li>

                                are prohibited on Crypto Car Club and will be removed.</li>
                            <li>Crypto Assets linked to assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections created or used primarily or substantially
